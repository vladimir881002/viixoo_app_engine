### Frontend Modules (`viixoo_frontend_apps`) TBD (To be defined, work in progress)

The frontend is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query), [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

## Frontend development

Before you begin, ensure that you have either the Node Version Manager (nvm) or Fast Node Manager (fnm) installed on your system.

* To install fnm follow the [official fnm guide](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#installation). If you prefer nvm, you can install it using the [official nvm guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

* After installing either nvm or fnm, proceed to the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```
* If the Node.js version specified in the `.nvmrc` file isn't installed on your system, you can install it using the appropriate command:

```bash
# If using fnm
fnm install

# If using nvm
nvm install
```

* Once the installation is complete, switch to the installed version:

```bash
# If using fnm
fnm use

# If using nvm
nvm use
```

* Within the `frontend` directory, install the necessary NPM packages:

```bash
npm install
```

* And start the live server with the following `npm` script:

```bash
npm run dev
```

* Then open your browser at http://localhost:5173/.
